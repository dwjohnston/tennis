# Tennis 

Implements tennis scoring logic. 

## Instructions 

Using node 18 

```
npm i 
npm test 
```


## Notes and caveats 

The examples given show the game score not being displayed if it is 0-0 (ie. only the set score is displayed). This functionality is reproduced here. 

The challenge says to not worry about validation - accordingly the logic does not account for what happens if we keep adding points after the set has already been won.
